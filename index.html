									<h2>INTRODUCTION<br />
									</h2>
									<p>If it's you who needs assistance with data, then you can stop looking since you've found it.
										The term "data" looks to be lot easier than it actually is. When data is disorganised, it resembles the ocean of information from which it is impossible to draw any conclusions. However, when data is organised and prepared correctly, it is ready to assist you in every manner. Due to this issue, you want a "data analyst" who can easily make the data available to you in the manner in which you require it.
									   Data analysis is no easy feat. It requires a high level of technical expertise, in-depth knowledge, and mastery of several tools and platforms. 
									   I, Bharath kr, who is an expert in data analysis, am prepared to assist you. I have mastered the art of working with the numerous platforms and tools needed for data analysis. I am a youthful, adaptable, and enthusiastic person. I approach the problems that come my way with a courageous heart. I believe that my desire to always learn new things has prepared me for the dynamic corporate environment
									   I have excellent interpersonal skills and make an excellent team player. I am a person who appears intelligent when working and resolving issues. This ability of mine sets me apart from others. I put in a lot of effort, but I also adapt my behaviour to the circumstances. It is one of the most crucial skills to master if you want to survive in the world of intense competition. I have learned this expertise since I am the part of  the renowned Indian Institute of Management Rohatk.
									   Given the chance to put my abilities and enthusiasm to use, I am sure that I will be a valuable asset to the organisations and put my all into improving it.

									<h2>Data Visualisation through Power BI<br />

								</header>
								<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/fundamentals/power-bi-overview" class="image fit"><img src="images/power-BI.webp" alt="" /></a>
								<p>You will be able to see the data visualizations and dashboard I prepared for this project. Real data was gathered from a website, cleansed, and categorized to aid in the creation of the visualizations. Additionally, I developed a dashboard using data that would walk you through a concise overview of the massive data offered. As a result, I made the data simple, easy to grasp, and user-friendly so that users could get it on their fingertips.
									This project serves as testimony of my proficiency with Power BI.

									<p>This project showcases my SQL expertise, knowledge, and comprehension. You will become acquainted with the information gathered from the Nashville Housing Department, which served as my project's source. I analyzed, explored and cleaned the data using my in-depth understanding of SQL, transforming the massive amounts of difficult to access and comprehend data, by making it 'ready-to-serve' for the users
										The data is presented and arranged in a way that is very easy to understand.

									<p>This project serves as an example of my Excel brilliance. By eliminating the duplicate data and other flaws, I converted the data into something that could be accessed and understood. I organized the data into graphs and charts and constructed pivot tables so that the user could get all the relevant information at once rather than wasting their valuable time searching for it.</p>
